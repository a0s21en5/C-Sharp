# Syntax

```
using System;

namespace HelloWorld
{
  class Program
  {
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
      Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");    
    }
  }
}
```

# Example explained

- Line 1: **using System** means that we can use classes from the System namespace.
- **Line 2:** A blank line. C# ignores white space.

- **Line 3:** namespace is used to organize your code, and it is a container for classes and other namespaces.

- **Line 4:** The curly braces {} marks the beginning and the end of a block of code.

- **Line 5:** class is a container for data and methods, which brings functionality to your program. Every line of code that runs in C# must be inside a class. In our example, we named the class Program.

- **Line 7:** Another thing that always appear in a C# program, is the Main method. Any code inside its curly brackets {} will be executed. You don't have to understand the keywords before and after Main. You will get to know them bit by bit while reading this tutorial.

- **Line 9:** Console is a class of the System namespace, which has a WriteLine() method that is used to output/print text. In our example it will output "Hello World!".

If you omit the using System line, you would have to write System.Console.WriteLine() to print/output text.

> **Note:** Every C# statement ends with a semicolon ;.

> **Note:** C# is case-sensitive: "MyClass" and "myclass" has different meaning.

# Keywords
